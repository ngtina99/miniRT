1. check in libft and miniRT makfile CFLAGS (I comment out on my own PC, because it is not compatible)
2. make sure to submit ALL libraries including minilibx
3. OPENGLFLAGS are only 1 time in makefile
4. rename my_mlx_pixel_put to for example set_pixel_color

5. I don't understand why the 0.0f set up to {0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f}; - Tina
t_vec3d	normalize(t_vec3d v)
{
	float magnitude;

	magnitude = sqrtf(v.x * v.x + v.y * v.y + v.z * v.z);
	if (magnitude == 0.0f) //TODO
		return (t_vec3d){0.0f, 0.0f, -1.0f};
	v.x /= magnitude;
	v.y /= magnitude;
	v.z /= magnitude;
	return (v);
}

6. I don't understand this part - Tina
    // Calculate the right and up vectors for the camera's orientation
	t_vec3d world_up = {0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f};
	t_vec3d right = normalize(cross_product(forward, world_up));
	t_vec3d up = normalize(cross_product(right, forward));

7. 	t_vec3d closest_hit_point; // TODO is it needed later?
